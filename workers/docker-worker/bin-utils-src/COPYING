### License information and attribution for binary utilities

We embed some statically linked utilities because building them is slow and
tedious. Besides we inject these libraries into docker containers, so by nature
they need to work on their own, hence, there is little value to rebuilding them
when deploying docker-worker.

Following utilities are embedded: 

 * busybox (GPL, see embedded LICENSE file in the source tarball)
 * x11vnc (GPL, see embeddded COPYING file in the source tarball)
 * list-displays (source is MPLv2, the distributable binary is GPL)

Both x11vnc and list-displays are statically linked with a number of X11
libraries and eglibc. Sources for these are readily available from debian
wheeze repositories.

License for all linked libraries is listed below for attribution and compliance.

Copyright from: /usr/share/doc/libjpeg8-dev/copyright

This is Debian's prepackaged version of the `jpeg library' by the Independent
JPEG Group.

This package was created by Mark Mickan <mmickan@debian.org> from sources
which can be found at ftp://ftp.uu.net/graphics/jpeg/jpegsrc.v6b.tar.gz

It is partly based on the libjpeg6a package originally put together by
Andy Guy <awpguy@acs.ucalgary.ca> and later maintained by Mark Mickan.

Current Debian maintainer is Bill Allombert <ballombe@debian.org>.

LEGAL ISSUES [ from README supplied with source - MM ]
============

In plain English:

1. We don't promise that this software works.  (But if you find any bugs,
   please let us know!)
2. You can use this software for whatever you want.  You don't have to pay us.
3. You may not pretend that you wrote this software.  If you use it in a
   program, you must acknowledge somewhere in your documentation that
   you've used the IJG code.

In legalese:

The authors make NO WARRANTY or representation, either express or implied,
with respect to this software, its quality, accuracy, merchantability, or
fitness for a particular purpose.  This software is provided "AS IS", and you,
its user, assume the entire risk as to its quality and accuracy.

This software is copyright (C) 1991-2010, Thomas G. Lane, Guido Vollbeding.
All Rights Reserved except as specified below.

Permission is hereby granted to use, copy, modify, and distribute this
software (or portions thereof) for any purpose, without fee, subject to these
conditions:
(1) If any part of the source code for this software is distributed, then this
README file must be included, with this copyright and no-warranty notice
unaltered; and any additions, deletions, or changes to the original files
must be clearly indicated in accompanying documentation.
(2) If only executable code is distributed, then the accompanying
documentation must state that "this software is based in part on the work of
the Independent JPEG Group".
(3) Permission for use of this software is granted only if the user accepts
full responsibility for any undesirable consequences; the authors accept
NO LIABILITY for damages of any kind.

These conditions apply to any software derived from or based on the IJG code,
not just to the unmodified library.  If you use our work, you ought to
acknowledge us.

Permission is NOT granted for the use of any IJG author's name or company name
in advertising or publicity relating to this software or products derived from
it.  This software may be referred to only as "the Independent JPEG Group's
software".

We specifically permit and encourage the use of this software as the basis of
commercial products, provided that all warranty or liability claims are
assumed by the product vendor.


ansi2knr.c is included in this distribution by permission of L. Peter Deutsch,
sole proprietor of its copyright holder, Aladdin Enterprises of Menlo Park, CA.
ansi2knr.c is NOT covered by the above copyright and conditions, but instead
by the usual distribution terms of the Free Software Foundation; principally,
that you must include source code if you redistribute it.  (See the file
ansi2knr.c for full details.)  However, since ansi2knr.c is not needed as part
of any program generated from the IJG code, this does not limit you more than
the foregoing paragraphs do.

The Unix configuration script "configure" was produced with GNU Autoconf.
It is copyright by the Free Software Foundation but is freely distributable.
The same holds for its supporting scripts (config.guess, config.sub,
ltmain.sh).  Another support script, install-sh, is copyright by X Consortium
but is also freely distributable.

The IJG distribution formerly included code to read and write GIF files.
To avoid entanglement with the Unisys LZW patent, GIF reading support has
been removed altogether, and the GIF writer has been simplified to produce
"uncompressed GIFs".  This technique does not use the LZW algorithm; the
resulting GIF files are larger than usual, but are readable by all standard
GIF decoders.

We are required to state that
    "The Graphics Interchange Format(c) is the Copyright property of
    CompuServe Incorporated.  GIF(sm) is a Service Mark property of
    CompuServe Incorporated."

Copyright from: /usr/share/doc/zlib1g-dev/copyright

This is the pre-packaged Debian Linux version of the zlib compression
library.  It was packaged by Michael Alan Dorman <mdorman@debian.org>
from sources originally retrieved from ftp.uu.net in the directory
/pub/archiving/zip/zlib as the file zlib-1.0.4.tar.gz.

There is a homepage at http://www.gzip.org/zlib/ 

Acknowledgments:

  The deflate format used by zlib was defined by Phil Katz. The deflate
  and zlib specifications were written by Peter Deutsch. Thanks to all the
  people who reported problems and suggested various improvements in zlib;
  they are too numerous to cite here.
