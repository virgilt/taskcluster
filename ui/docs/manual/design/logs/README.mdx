# Structured Logs

Taskcluster services ouptut log data in a format that is suitable for automated consumption -- structured logging.
The log data takes the form of a single-line JSON object.

## Log Entry Properties

Log messages are output in a format that is a superset of the "mozlog" format expected of critical services at Mozilla, and the format required for Google Stackdriver logging.
The fields are:

```yaml
{
  "Timestamp": ... # <time since unix epoch in nanoseconds>,
  "Type": "...", # message type
  "message": "...", # a plain-text version of the message (optional)
  "serviceContext": {"service": "..."}, # TC service producing the data
  "Logger": "...", # component within the service producing the data
  "Hostname": "...", # (not useful in most deployments)
  "Severity": ..., # numeric syslog severity
  "severity": ..., # corresponding upper-case severity name
  "Pid": ..., # (not useful in most deployments)
  "Fields": {...}
  "EnvVersion": "2.0", # defines the version of the log format
  "traceId": "...", # When this is defined, it is an opaque string that can be used to correlate log events that are part of a single chain of requests
  "requestId": "..." # When this is defined, this is unique to a particular request within the chain of requests
}
```

The content of `Fields` can be any arbitary data but certain `Type`s are defined
in the docs site where we ensure that for any messages with that type, the content
of `Fields` will contain certain keys.

The [reference documentation](/docs/reference) defines the log messages output by each service and the meaning assigned to their fields.

## Trace and Request Ids

Not all logs take place inside the context of a web request, but those that do are tagged with `traceId` and `requestId` fields.
These can be used to correlate related log entries together. A `traceId` is created at the entrypoint to the entire Taskcluster deployment
and as the request passes through among various services, it stays the same the entire time. An example of this would be a request
from the UI to create a new task.

```
UI -> nginx/load-balancer -> web-server -> queue -> auth
```

The request is received by nginx and a header is added to the request that will then be forwarded along to web-server, queue, and then auth. Each
one will attach this `traceId` to log events.

Each step in this is a single request and each request will have a unique `requestId`. This can be used in two ways. First is to correlate
multiple log events that are a part of servicing that request. An example would be:

```
{requestId: 123, Type: foo-started}
{requestId: 123, Type: foo-complete}
{requestId: 123, Type: returned}
```

The second use-case is for telling apart separate requests to a service as part of a trace that are made because of some sort of retry. This way
you can tell apart the two requests.

`traceId` is passed around as a header `x-taskcluster-trace-id` between services. If an external request
sets this header, it will be used. To avoid misuse of this, we recommend running Taskcluster behind
a reverse proxy that will set this header itself and then using `k8s-dns` serviceDiscoveryScheme for
your services.
