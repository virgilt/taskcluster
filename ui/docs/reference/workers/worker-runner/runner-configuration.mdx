# Runner Configuration File

The runner configuration file is passed to `start-worker` to configure worker-runner.
It is distinct from configuration files for workers.

## File Format

<!-- RUNNER-CONFIG BEGIN -->

Configuration for worker-runner is in the form of a YAML file with
the following fields:

* `provider`: (required) information about the provider for this worker

  * `providerType`: (required) the worker-manager providerType responsible for
    this worker; this generally indicates the cloud the worker is running in,
    or 'static' for a non-cloud-based worker; see below.

* `worker`: (required) information about the worker being run

  * `implementation`: (required) the name of the worker implementation; see
    below.

* `workerConfig`: arbitrary data which forms the basics of the config passed to
  the worker; this will be merged with several other sources of configuration.
  Note that the nested `<workerImplementation>.config` structure is not allowed
  here.

* `logging`: configuration for where logs from this application and from the
  worker should be sent.  This defaults to the `stdio` logging implementation.

  * `implementation`: the name of the logging implementation; see below.

* `getSecrets`: if true (the default), then configuration is fetched from the
  secrets service and merged with the worker configuration.  This option is
  generally only used in testing.

* `cacheOverRestarts`: if set to a filename, then the runner state is written
  to this JSON file at startup.  On subsequent startups, if the file exists,
  then it is loaded and the worker started directly without consulting
  worker-manager or any other external resources.  This is useful for worker
  implementations that restart the system as part of their normal operation
  and expect to start up with the same config after a restart.

**NOTE** for Windows users: the configuration file must be a UNIX-style text file.
DOS-style newlines and encodings other than utf-8 are not supported.
<!-- RUNNER-CONFIG END -->

## Example

What follows is an example runner configuration file, illustrating how these parts
might come together.

```yaml
provider:
  providerType: azure

worker:
  implementation: generic-worker
  path: /usr/local/bin/generic-worker
  configPath: /etc/taskcluster/generic-worker/config.yaml

workerConfig:
  ed25519SigningKeyLocation: /etc/taskcluster/generic-worker/signing.key

cacheOverRestarts: true
```


While most configuration should come from the worker pool definition in worker-manager, it makes sense to include configuration that is specific to the VM image (such as filesystem paths) in the runner config.
The `cacheOverRestarts` option is set because the generic-worker build used here (multiuser) will reboot after every task, so worker-runner must cache its state over those reboots.
