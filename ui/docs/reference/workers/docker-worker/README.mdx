# Docker Worker

docker-worker is a worker for Taskcluster, designed to run arbitrary tasks in a containerized environment.

This documentation is a work in progress.

## Using the Worker

Given a worker pool that is running docker-worker, you can create tasks with a payload in [this format](/docs/reference/workers/docker-worker/payload).

See also:

 * [Features](/docs/reference/workers/docker-worker/features) - optional additional features of the  worker
 * [Caches](/docs/reference/workers/docker-worker/caches) - caching data between tasks
 * [Scopes](/docs/reference/workers/docker-worker/scopes) - additional scopes required for features, capabilities, and caches
 * [Environment Variables](/docs/reference/workers/docker-worker/environment) - enviroment variables available to running tasks

## Deployment

See [deployment](/docs/reference/workers/docker-worker/deployment) for details on deploying docker-worker.
